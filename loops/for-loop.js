// READ THIS TUTORIAL LINE BY LINE AND IT SHOULD MAKE SENSE


// THIS IS A 'FOR' LOOP, named for the...'for'.
for (let count = 0; count < 10; count++) {
  console.log(i);

/*
 // IT IS CONSTRUCTED LIKE SO

    // FOR LOOP BODY

    // like make a pretty girl wave hello.
    // does she keep waving like a lunatic, making you concerned,
    // or wave three times, then you go out for coffee?

}

 HOW TO READ IT IN ENGLISH (like a sentence)

  for (let count = 0;
          for our 'count' is equal to zero;  (starting from 0)
      count < 10;
          as long as 'count' is less than 10;  (keep going until we count to ten)
      count++)
          'count' up by one more number (we haven't reached ten yet, so we need to keep counting)

  {
    // PUT THINGS TO DO INSIDE OPENING AND CLOSING CURLY BRACES
    // every time we count to one, things happen in here
    // like jumping rope.
    // you start at 0.
    // you jump the rope, that's one.
    // jump again, two...until you jump ten times
  }
